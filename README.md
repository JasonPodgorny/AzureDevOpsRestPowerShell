# JP_AzDevopsRest_Powershell
Powershell Module For Managing Azure Devops Via REST Calls.   Extremely fast.   Can be expanded quickly.   Azure DevOps has lots of cool options that are available in REST.

Only have a few functions currently, will be adding a lot more but this is initial commit starter.

This module also serves as a great starting point for any REST oriented Powershell modules, and could be repurposed with the calls to NSX being replaced with calls to any REST based endpoint.

In the NSX Powershell Repo There Is A Control Script That Shows Some Usage Examples For That One And How To Use Credentials To Feed Password More Securely.   Lots Of Options Available For This, But This Is One Option.
